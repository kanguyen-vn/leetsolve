    "content": "You are given an array of network towers  and an integer , where  denotes the  network tower with location  and quality factor . All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.\nThe integer  denotes the maximum distance in which the tower is reachable. The tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to . Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.\nThe signal quality of the  tower at a coordinate  is calculated with the formula , where  is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.\nReturn the integral coordinate where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum coordinate.\n"
