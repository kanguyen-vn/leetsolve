A four-person group\u00a0occupies four\u00a0adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3]\u00a0and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case\u00a0on which an aisle split\u00a0a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split\u00a0a four-person group in the middle,\u00a0which means to have two people on each side.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll  are distinct.\n\n"
