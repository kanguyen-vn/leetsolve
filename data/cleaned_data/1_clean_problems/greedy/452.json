    "content": "There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.\nAn arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with  and  bursts by an arrow shot at  if . There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.\nGiven an array  where , return\u00a0the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
