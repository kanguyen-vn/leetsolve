In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.\nFind any matrix of non-negative integers of size  that satisfies the  and  requirements.\nReturn a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"
