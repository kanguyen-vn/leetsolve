Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like  or .\n\nExpressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example,  has an answer of .\nThe format of the output is as follows:\n\nFor each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like , only .\nTerms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example,  has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.\nThe leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)\u00a0 A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.\nAn example of a well formatted answer is \u00a0\nTerms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.\u00a0 For example, an expression of \"0\" has an output of [].\n\nExamples:\n"
