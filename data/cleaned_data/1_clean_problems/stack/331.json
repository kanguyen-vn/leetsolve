    "content": "One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as .\n\nFor example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string , where  represents a null node.\nGiven a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.\nEach comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character  representing  pointer.\nYou may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as .\n\n\n\n\n\n"
