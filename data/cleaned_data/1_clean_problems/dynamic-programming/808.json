    "content": "There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially we have  ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:\n\nServe\u00a0100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B\nServe\u00a075 ml of soup A and 25\u00a0ml of soup B\nServe 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B\nServe 25\u00a0ml of soup A and 75\u00a0ml of soup B\n\nWhen we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.\u00a0 Each turn,\u00a0we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve\u00a0as much as we can.\u00a0 We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.\nNote that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.\u00a0\u00a0\nReturn the probability that soup A will be empty\u00a0first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.\n\u00a0\n\n"
