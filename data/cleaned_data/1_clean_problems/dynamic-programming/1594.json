The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.\nReturn the\u00a0maximum non-negative product\u00a0modulo\u00a0.\u00a0If the maximum product is negative return\u00a0.\nNotice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"
