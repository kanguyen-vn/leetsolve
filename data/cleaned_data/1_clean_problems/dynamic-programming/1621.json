The endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. The  line segments do not have to cover all  points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.\nReturn the number of ways we can draw  non-overlapping line segments.\u00a0Since this number can be huge, return it modulo .\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n"
