    "content": "We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an \"L\" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.\n\nGiven N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)\n\n"
