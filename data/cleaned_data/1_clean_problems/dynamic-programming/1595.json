The groups are connected if each point in both\u00a0groups is\u00a0connected to one or more points in the opposite\u00a0group. In other words, each\u00a0point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each\u00a0point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.\nReturn\u00a0the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
