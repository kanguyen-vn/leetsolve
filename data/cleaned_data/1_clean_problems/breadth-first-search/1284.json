A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one edge.\nReturn the minimum number of steps required to convert \u00a0to a zero matrix or -1 if you cannot.\nBinary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only.\nZero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n is 0 or 1.\n\n"
