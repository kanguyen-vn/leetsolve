They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.\nNow given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their\u00a0subordinates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n"
