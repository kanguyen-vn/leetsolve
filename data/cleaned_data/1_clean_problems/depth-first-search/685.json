The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.\n\nThe resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of .  Each element of  is a pair  that represents a directed edge connecting nodes  and , where  is a parent of child .\n\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of N nodes.  If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.\n\n\n\n\n"
