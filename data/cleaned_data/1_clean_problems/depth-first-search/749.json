    "content": "\nA virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.\n\nThe world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected cells, and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.\n\nEvery night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.\nResources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.\n\nCan you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
