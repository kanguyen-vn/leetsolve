    "content": "There are  cities numbered from 1 to . You are given an array  of size , where  represents a bidirectional edge between cities  and . There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.\nA subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.\nFor each  from 1 to , find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to .\nReturn an array of size  where the  element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to .\nNotice\u00a0that\u00a0the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll pairs  are distinct.\n"
