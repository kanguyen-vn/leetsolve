You will be given an integer array  of size  where  is the number of balls of color .\u00a0\nAll the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random,\u00a0then we will distribute the first  balls to the first box and the remaining  balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).\nPlease note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors  and , and two boxes  and , then the distribution  is considered different than the distribution (Please read the explanation of the first\u00a0example carefully).\nWe want to calculate the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n is even.\nAnswers within  of the actual value will be accepted as correct.\n\n"
