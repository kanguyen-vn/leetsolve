There are  introverts and  extroverts.\nYou should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.\nThe happiness of each person is calculated as follows:\n\nIntroverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).\nExtroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).\n\nNeighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.\nThe grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"
