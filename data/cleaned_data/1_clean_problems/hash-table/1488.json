If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.\nGiven an integer array  where:\n\n means there will be rains over the  lake.\n means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.\n\nReturn an array  where:\n\n\n if .\n is the lake you choose to dry in the  day\u00a0if .\n\nIf there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.\nNotice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"
