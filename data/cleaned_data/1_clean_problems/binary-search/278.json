Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.\nSuppose you have  versions  and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.\nYou are given an API  which returns whether  is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n"
