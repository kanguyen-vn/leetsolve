    "content": "Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.\nDo not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.\nThe order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.\nClarification:\nConfused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?\nNote that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.\nInternally you can think of this:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
