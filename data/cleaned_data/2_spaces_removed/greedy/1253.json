The sum of elements of the 0-th(upper) row is given as . The sum of elements of the 1-st(lower) row is given as . The sum of elements in the i-th column(0-indexed) is , where is given as an integer array with length . Your task is to reconstruct the matrix with , and . Return it as a 2-D integer array. If there are more than one valid solution, any of them will be accepted. If no valid solution exists, return an empty 2-D array."
