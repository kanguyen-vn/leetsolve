    "content": "Given a string of digits, such as , we can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list of non-negative integers such that: , (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit signed integer type); ; andfor all . Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself. Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from , or return if it cannot be done."
