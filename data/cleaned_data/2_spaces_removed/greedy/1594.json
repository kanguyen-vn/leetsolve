    "content": "You are given a matrix . Initially, you are located at the top-left corner , and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix. Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner and ending in the bottom-right corner , find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path. Return the maximum non-negative product modulo . If the maximum product is negative return . Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product."
