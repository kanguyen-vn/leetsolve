    "content": "Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values. For each node at position , its left and right children respectively will be at positions and . Running a vertical line from to , whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing coordinates). If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller. Return an list of non-empty reports in order of coordinate. Every report will have a list of values of nodes."
