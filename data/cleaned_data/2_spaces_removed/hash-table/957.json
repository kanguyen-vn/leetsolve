    "content": "There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant. Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules: If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied. Otherwise, it becomes vacant. (Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.) We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: if the -th cell is occupied, else . Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after days (and such changes described above.)"
