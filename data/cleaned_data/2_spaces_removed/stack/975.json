    "content": "You are given an integer array . From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices. You may jump forward from index to index (with ) in the following way: During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index such that and is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices , you can only jump to the smallest such index . During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index such that and is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices , you can only jump to the smallest such index . It may be the case that for some index , there are no legal jumps. A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index ) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once). Return the number of good starting indices."
