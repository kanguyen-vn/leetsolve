    "content": "Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory. Clarification: Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array? Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller. Internally you can think of this: is sorted in ascending order."
