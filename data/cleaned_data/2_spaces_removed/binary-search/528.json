We need to call the function which randomly returns an integer in the range . should return the integer proportional to its weight in the array. For example, for , the probability of picking the index 0 is (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index 1 is (i.e 75%). More formally, the probability of picking index is . will be called at most 10000 times."
