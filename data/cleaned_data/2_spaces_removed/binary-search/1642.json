You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders. While moving from building to building (0-indexed), If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks. If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or bricks. Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally."
