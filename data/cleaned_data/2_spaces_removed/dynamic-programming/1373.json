    "content": "Given a binary tree , the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST). Assume a BST is defined as follows: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. The given binary tree will have between 1 and 40000 nodes. Each node's value is between ."
