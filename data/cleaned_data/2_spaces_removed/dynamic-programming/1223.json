    "content": "A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number more than (1-indexed) consecutive times. Given an array of integers and an integer , return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact rolls. Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo ."
