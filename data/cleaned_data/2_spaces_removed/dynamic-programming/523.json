    "content": "Given a list of non-negative numbers and a target integer k, write a function to check if the array has a continuous subarray of size at least 2 that sums up to a multiple of k, that is, sums up to n*k where n is also an integer. The length of the array won't exceed 10,000. You may assume the sum of all the numbers is in the range of a signed 32-bit integer."
