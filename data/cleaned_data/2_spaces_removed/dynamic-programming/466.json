On the other hand, we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1. For example, abc can be obtained from abdbec based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from acbbe . You are given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 (each at most 100 characters long) and two integers 0 n1 106 and 1 n2 106. Now consider the strings S1 and S2, where and . Find the maximum integer M such that can be obtained from ."
