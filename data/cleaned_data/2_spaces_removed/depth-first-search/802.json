    "content": "In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop. Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there exists a natural number so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than steps. Which nodes are eventually safe? Return them as an array in sorted order. The directed graph has nodes with labels , where is the length of . The graph is given in the following form: is a list of labels such that is a directed edge of the graph."
