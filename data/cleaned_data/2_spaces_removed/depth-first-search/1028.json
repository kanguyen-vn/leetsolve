At each node in this traversal, we output dashes (where is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node. If the depth of a node is , the depth of its immediate child is . The depth of the node is 0. If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child. Given the output of this traversal, recover the tree and return its . The number of nodes in the original tree is in the range ."
