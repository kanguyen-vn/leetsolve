The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string (i.e. The node with the number has the label ). The array is given on the form , which means there is an edge between nodes and in the tree. Return an array of size where is the number of nodes in the subtree of the node which have the same label as node . A subtree of a tree is the tree consisting of a node in and all of its descendant nodes. is consisting of only of lower-case English letters."
