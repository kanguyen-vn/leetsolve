    "content": "You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below. Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list. How multilevel linked list is represented in test case: We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above: The serialization of each level is as follows: To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes: Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain: Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000."
