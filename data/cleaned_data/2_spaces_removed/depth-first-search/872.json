For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is . Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same. Return if and only if the two given trees with head nodes and are leaf-similar. The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range . Both of the given trees will have values in the range ."
