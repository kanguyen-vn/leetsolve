    "content": "Consider a directed graph, with nodes labelled . In this graph, each edge is either red or blue, and there could be self-edges or parallel edges. Each in denotes a red directed edge from node to node . Similarly, each in denotes a blue directed edge from node to node . Return an array of length , where each is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node such that the edge colors alternate along the path (or if such a path doesn't exist)."
