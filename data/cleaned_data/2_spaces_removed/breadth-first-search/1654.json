    "content": "A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position . Help them get there from position 0. The bug jumps according to the following rules: It can jump exactly positions forward (to the right). It can jump exactly positions backward (to the left). It cannot jump backward twice in a row. It cannot jump to any positions. The bug may jump forward beyond its home, but it cannot jump to positions numbered with negative integers. Given an array of integers , where means that the bug cannot jump to the position , and integers , , and , return the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position , return All the elements in are distinct. Position is not forbidden."
