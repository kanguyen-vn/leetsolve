The sign of can be: 1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from to ) 2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from to ) 3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from to ) 4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from to ) Notice that there could be some invalid signs on the cells of the which points outside the . You will initially start at the upper left cell . A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell and ends at the bottom-right cell following the signs on the grid. The valid path doesn't have to be the shortest. You can modify the sign on a cell with . You can modify the sign on a cell one time only. Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path."
