    "content": "Given an undirected , return if and only if it is bipartite. Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split its set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B, such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B. The graph is given in the following form: is a list of indexes for which the edge between nodes and exists. Each node is an integer between 0 and . There are no self edges or parallel edges: does not contain , and it doesn't contain any element twice. All the values of are unique. The graph is guaranteed to be undirected."
