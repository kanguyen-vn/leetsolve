    "content": "In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth node are at depth . Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have different parents. We are given the of a binary tree with unique values, and the values and of two different nodes in the tree. Return if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values and are cousins. The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100. Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100."
