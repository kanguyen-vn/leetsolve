    "content": "Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples). The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000. The total number of nodes is between ."
