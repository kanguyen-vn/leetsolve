    "content": "A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right. For example, the above binary watch reads \"3:25\". Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent."
