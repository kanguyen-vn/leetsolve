We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 &lt;= i &lt;= N) in this array: The number at the ith position is divisible by i. i is divisible by the number at the ith position. Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?"
