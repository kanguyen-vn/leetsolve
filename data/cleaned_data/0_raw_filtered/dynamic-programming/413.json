A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 &lt;= P &lt; Q &lt; N.</p>\n\n<p>A slice (P, Q) of the array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:<br>\nA[P], A[P&nbsp;+ 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 &lt; Q.</p>\n\n<p>The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n\n<pre>A = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nreturn: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.\n</pre>\n</div>"
