    "content": "<div><p>Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.</p>\n\n<p>Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> [1, 5, 2]\n<b>Output:</b> False\n<b>Explanation:</b> Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. \nIf he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). \nSo, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. \nHence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> [1, 5, 233, 7]\n<b>Output:</b> True\n<b>Explanation:</b> Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.\nFinally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1 &lt;= length of the array &lt;= 20.</li>\n\t<li>Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.</li>\n\t<li>If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
