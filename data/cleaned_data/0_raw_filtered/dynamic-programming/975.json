    "content": "<div><p>You are given an integer array <code>A</code>. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called <strong>odd-numbered jumps</strong>, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called <strong>even-numbered jumps</strong>. Note that the <strong>jumps</strong> are numbered, not the indices.</p>\n\n<p>You may jump forward from index <code>i</code> to index <code>j</code> (with <code>i &lt; j</code>) in the following way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>During <strong>odd-numbered jumps</strong> (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index <code>j</code> such that <code>A[i] &lt;= A[j]</code> and <code>A[j]</code> is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices <code>j</code>, you can only jump to the <strong>smallest</strong> such index <code>j</code>.</li>\n\t<li>During <strong>even-numbered jumps</strong> (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index <code>j</code> such that <code>A[i] &gt;= A[j]</code> and <code>A[j]</code> is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices <code>j</code>, you can only jump to the <strong>smallest</strong> such index <code>j</code>.</li>\n\t<li>It may be the case that for some index <code>i</code>, there are no legal jumps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A starting index is <strong>good</strong> if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index <code>A.length - 1</code>) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the number of <strong>good</strong> starting indices</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> A = [10,13,12,14,15]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since A[2] is the smallest among A[1], A[2], A[3],\nA[4] that is greater or equal to A[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> A = [2,3,1,1,4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\n\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because A[1] is the smallest value in [A[1], A[2],\nA[3], A[4]] that is greater than or equal to A[0].\n\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because A[2] is the largest value in [A[2], A[3],\nA[4]] that is less than or equal to A[1]. A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can\nonly jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\n\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in [A[3], A[4]]\nthat is greater than or equal to A[2].\n\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> A = [5,1,3,4,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nWe can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= A[i] &lt; 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
