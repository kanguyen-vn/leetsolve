    "content": "<div><p>Alice and Bob continue their&nbsp;games with piles of stones. There are several stones&nbsp;<strong>arranged in a row</strong>, and each stone has an associated&nbsp;value which is an integer given in the array&nbsp;<code>stoneValue</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Alice and Bob take turns, with <strong>Alice</strong> starting first. On each player's turn, that player&nbsp;can take <strong>1, 2 or 3 stones</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the <strong>first</strong> remaining stones in the row.</p>\n\n<p>The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is <strong>0</strong>&nbsp;initially.</p>\n\n<p>The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.</p>\n\n<p>Assume&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;and Bob&nbsp;<strong>play optimally</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>\"Alice\"</em> if&nbsp;Alice will win, <em>\"Bob\"</em> if Bob will win or <em>\"Tie\"</em> if they end the game with the same score.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> \"Bob\"\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,-9]\n<strong>Output:</strong> \"Alice\"\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.\nIf Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.\nIf Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.\nRemember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,6]\n<strong>Output:</strong> \"Tie\"\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,-1,-2,-3,7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> \"Alice\"\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> values = [-1,-2,-3]\n<strong>Output:</strong> \"Tie\"\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= values.length &lt;= 50000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>-1000&nbsp;&lt;= values[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n</ul></div>"
