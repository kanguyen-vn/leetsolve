    "content": "<div><p>There are <em>N</em> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station <em>i</em> is <code>gas[i]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from station <em>i</em> to its next station (<em>i</em>+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</p>\n\n<p>Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If there exists a&nbsp;solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.</li>\n\t<li>Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.</li>\n\t<li>Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> \ngas  = [1,2,3,4,5]\ncost = [3,4,5,1,2]\n\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n\n<strong>Explanation:\n</strong>Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\nTravel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\nTravel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\nTherefore, return 3 as the starting index.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> \ngas  = [2,3,4]\ncost = [3,4,3]\n\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n\n<strong>Explanation:\n</strong>You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.\nLet's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\nTravel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3\nTravel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3\nYou cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.\nTherefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.\n</pre>\n</div>"
