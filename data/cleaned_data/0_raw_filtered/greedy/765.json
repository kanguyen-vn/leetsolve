A <i>swap</i> consists of choosing <b>any</b> two people, then they stand up and switch seats. \n</p><p>\nThe people and seats are represented by an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>2N-1</code>, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being <code>(0, 1)</code>, the second couple being <code>(2, 3)</code>, and so on with the last couple being <code>(2N-2, 2N-1)</code>.\n</p><p>\nThe couples' initial seating is given by <code>row[i]</code> being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.\n\n</p><p><b>Example 1:</b><br></p><pre><b>Input:</b> row = [0, 2, 1, 3]\n<b>Output:</b> 1\n<b>Explanation:</b> We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.\n</pre><p></p>\n\n<p><b>Example 2:</b><br></p><pre><b>Input:</b> row = [3, 2, 0, 1]\n<b>Output:</b> 0\n<b>Explanation:</b> All couples are already seated side by side.\n</pre><p></p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b>\n</p><ol> \n<li> <code>len(row)</code> is even and in the range of <code>[4, 60]</code>.</li>\n<li> <code>row</code> is guaranteed to be a permutation of <code>0...len(row)-1</code>.</li>\n</ol></div>"
