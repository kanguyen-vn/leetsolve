The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D map, in this map:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><code>0</code> represents the <code>obstacle</code> can't be reached.</li>\n\t<li><code>1</code> represents the <code>ground</code> can be walked through.</li>\n\t<li><code>The place with number bigger than 1</code> represents a <code>tree</code> can be walked through, and this positive number represents the tree's height.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In one step you can walk in any of the four directions <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>&nbsp;also when standing in a point which is a tree you can decide whether or not to cut off the tree.</p>\n\n<p>You are asked to cut off <b>all</b> the trees in this forest in the order of tree's height - always cut off the tree with lowest height first. And after cutting, the original place has the tree will become a grass (value 1).</p>\n\n<p>You will start from the point (0, 0) and you should output the minimum steps <b>you need to walk</b> to cut off all the trees. If you can't cut off all the trees, output -1 in that situation.</p>\n\n<p>You are guaranteed that no two <code>trees</code> have the same height and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> \n[\n [1,2,3],\n [0,0,4],\n [7,6,5]\n]\n<b>Output:</b> 6\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> \n[\n [1,2,3],\n [0,0,0],\n [7,6,5]\n]\n<b>Output:</b> -1\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 3:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> \n[\n [2,3,4],\n [0,0,5],\n [8,7,6]\n]\n<b>Output:</b> 6\n<b>Explanation:</b> You started from the point (0,0) and you can cut off the tree in (0,0) directly without walking.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= forest.length &lt;= 50</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= forest[i].length &lt;= 50</code></li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= forest[i][j]&nbsp;&lt;= 10^9</code></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
