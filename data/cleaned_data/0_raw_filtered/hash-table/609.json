Note that n &gt;= 1 and m &gt;= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.</p>\n\n<p>The <b>output</b> is a list of group of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"directory_path/file_name.txt\"</code></p>\n\n<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n[\"root/a 1.txt(abcd) 2.txt(efgh)\", \"root/c 3.txt(abcd)\", \"root/c/d 4.txt(efgh)\", \"root 4.txt(efgh)\"]\n<b>Output:</b>  \n[[\"root/a/2.txt\",\"root/c/d/4.txt\",\"root/4.txt\"],[\"root/a/1.txt\",\"root/c/3.txt\"]]\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>No order is required for the final output.</li>\n\t<li>You may assume the directory name, file name and file content only has letters and digits, and the length of file content is in the range of [1,50].</li>\n\t<li>The number of files given is in the range of [1,20000].</li>\n\t<li>You may assume no files or directories share the same name in the same directory.</li>\n\t<li>You may assume each given directory info represents a unique directory. Directory path and file info are separated by a single blank space.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<b>Follow-up beyond contest:</b>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS?</li>\n\t<li>If the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution?</li>\n\t<li>If you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution?</li>\n\t<li>What is the time complexity of your modified solution? What is the most time-consuming part and memory consuming part of it? How to optimize?</li>\n\t<li>How to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"
