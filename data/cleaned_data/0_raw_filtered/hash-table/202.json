Those numbers for which this process <strong>ends in 1</strong> are happy numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Return True if <code>n</code> is a happy number, and False if not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 19\n<strong>Output:</strong> true\n<strong>Explanation: \n</strong>1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82\n8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68\n6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100\n1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1\n</pre>\n</div>"
