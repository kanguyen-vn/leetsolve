Now, given the Teemo's attacking <b>ascending</b> time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.</p>\n\n<p>You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> [1,4], 2\n<b>Output:</b> 4\n<b>Explanation:</b> At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. \nThis poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. \nAnd at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. \nSo you finally need to output 4.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> [1,2], 2\n<b>Output:</b> 3\n<b>Explanation:</b> At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. \nThis poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. \nHowever, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. \nSince the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. \nSo you finally need to output 3.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.</li>\n\t<li>You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"
