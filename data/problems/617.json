The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> \n\tTree 1                     Tree 2                  \n          1                         2                             \n         / \\                       / \\                            \n        3   2                     1   3                        \n       /                           \\   \\                      \n      5                             4   7                  \n<b>Output:</b> \nMerged tree:\n\t     3\n\t    / \\\n\t   4   5\n\t  / \\   \\ \n\t 5   4   7\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b> The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.</p>\n</div>"
