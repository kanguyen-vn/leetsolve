The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Example 1:</b><br>\n</p><pre><b>Input:</b> [1,2,1]\n<b>Output:</b> [2,-1,2]\n<b>Explanation:</b> The first 1's next greater number is 2; <br>The number 2 can't find next greater number; <br>The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b>\nThe length of given array won't exceed 10000.\n</p></div>"
