Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.</p>\n\n<p>For example,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre>Given the tree:\n        4\n       / \\\n      2   7\n     / \\\n    1   3\n\nAnd the value to search: 2\n</pre>\n\n<p>You should return this subtree:</p>\n\n<pre>      2     \n     / \\   \n    1   3\n</pre>\n\n<p>In the example above, if we want to search the value <code>5</code>, since there is no node with value <code>5</code>, we should return <code>NULL</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that an empty tree is represented by <code>NULL</code>, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as&nbsp;<code>[]</code>, not <code>null</code>.</p>\n</div>"
