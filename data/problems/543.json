The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the <b>longest</b> path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Example:</b><br>\nGiven a binary tree <br>\n</p><pre>          1\n         / \\\n        2   3\n       / \\     \n      4   5    \n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nReturn <b>3</b>, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b>\nThe length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n</p></div>"
