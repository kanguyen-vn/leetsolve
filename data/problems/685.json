The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.\n</p><p>\nThe resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of <code>edges</code>.  Each element of <code>edges</code> is a pair <code>[u, v]</code> that represents a <b>directed</b> edge connecting nodes <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, where <code>u</code> is a parent of child <code>v</code>.\n</p><p>\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of N nodes.
