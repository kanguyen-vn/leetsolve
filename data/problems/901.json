Then:\nS.next(100) is called and returns 1,\nS.next(80) is called and returns 1,\nS.next(60) is called and returns 1,\nS.next(70) is called and returns 2,\nS.next(60) is called and returns 1,\nS.next(75) is called and returns 4,\nS.next(85) is called and returns 6.\n\nNote that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices\n(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Calls to <code>StockSpanner.next(int price)</code> will have <code>1 &lt;= price &lt;= 10^5</code>.</li>\n\t<li>There will be at most <code>10000</code> calls to <code>StockSpanner.next</code>&nbsp;per test case.</li>\n\t<li>There will be at most <code>150000</code> calls to <code>StockSpanner.next</code> across all test cases.</li>\n\t<li>The total&nbsp;time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for&nbsp;C++, and 50% for all other languages.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>"
