    "content": "<div><p>A sequence of numbers is called a <strong>wiggle sequence</strong> if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <code>[1,7,4,9,2,5]</code> is a wiggle sequence because the differences <code>(6,-3,5,-7,3)</code> are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, <code>[1,4,7,2,5]</code> and <code>[1,7,4,5,5]</code> are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.</p>\n\n<p>Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id=\"example-input-1-1\">[1,7,4,9,2,5]</span>\n<strong>Output: </strong><span id=\"example-output-1\">6\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> </span>The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.</pre>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input: </strong><span id=\"example-input-2-1\">[1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]</span>\n<strong>Output: </strong><span id=\"example-output-2\">7\n</span><span id=\"example-output-1\"><strong>Explanation: </strong></span>There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
