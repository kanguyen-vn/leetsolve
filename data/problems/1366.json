If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.</p>\n\n<p>Given an array of strings <code>votes</code> which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems.
