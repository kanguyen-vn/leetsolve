A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1]</code>.&nbsp; Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth 1 point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, if we have <code>[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]</code>, and we rotate by <code>K = 2</code>, it becomes <code>[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]</code>.&nbsp; This is worth 3 points because 1 &gt; 0 [no points], 3 &gt; 1 [no points], 0 &lt;= 2 [one point], 2 &lt;= 3 [one point], 4 &lt;= 4 [one point].</p>\n\n<p>Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest score we could receive.&nbsp; If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index K.</p>\n\n<pre><strong>Example 1:</strong>\n<strong>Input:</strong> [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 3\n<strong>Explanation: </strong> \nScores for each K are listed below: \nK = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2\nK = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3\nK = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3\nK = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4\nK = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3\n</pre>\n\n<p>So we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre><strong>Example 2:</strong>\n<strong>Input:</strong> [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation: </strong> A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.\nSo we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>A</code>&nbsp;will have&nbsp;length at most <code>20000</code>.</li>\n\t<li><code>A[i]</code> will be in the range <code>[0, A.length]</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
