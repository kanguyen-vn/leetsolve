The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.\n</p><p>\nThe resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of <code>edges</code>.  Each element of <code>edges</code> is a pair <code>[u, v]</code> with <code>u &lt; v</code>, that represents an <b>undirected</b> edge connecting nodes <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>.\n</p><p>\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes.  If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.  The answer edge <code>[u, v]</code> should be in the same format, with <code>u &lt; v</code>.\n</p><p><b>Example 1:</b><br>\n</p><pre><b>Input:</b> [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]\n<b>Output:</b> [2,3]\n<b>Explanation:</b> The given undirected graph will be like this:\n  1\n / \\\n2 - 3\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Example 2:</b><br>\n</p><pre><b>Input:</b> [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]\n<b>Output:</b> [1,4]\n<b>Explanation:</b> The given undirected graph will be like this:\n5 - 1 - 2\n    |   |\n    4 - 3\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br>\n</p><li>The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.</li>\n<li>Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.</li>\n<p></p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\n<b><font color=\"red\">Update (2017-09-26):</font></b><br>\nWe have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an <b><i>undirected</i></b> graph.
