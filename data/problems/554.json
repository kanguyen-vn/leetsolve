You want to draw a vertical line from the <b>top</b> to the <b>bottom</b> and cross the <b>least</b> bricks.</p>\n\n<p>The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.</p>\n\n<p>If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.</p>\n\n<p><b>You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks. </b></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b> [[1,2,2,1],\n        [3,1,2],\n        [1,3,2],\n        [2,4],\n        [3,1,2],\n        [1,3,1,1]]\n\n<b>Output:</b> 2\n\n<b>Explanation:</b> \n<img src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/brick_wall.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 350px\">\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.</li>\n\t<li>The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000].
