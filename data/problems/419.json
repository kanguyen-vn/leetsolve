You may assume the following rules:\n\n<ul>\n<li>You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.</li>\n<li>Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape <code>1xN</code> (1 row, N columns) or <code>Nx1</code> (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.</li>\n<li>At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b><br>\n</p><pre>X..X\n...X\n...X\n</pre>\nIn the above board there are 2 battleships.\n\n<p><b>Invalid Example:</b><br>\n</p><pre>...X\nXXXX\n...X\n</pre>\nThis is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them.\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Follow up:</b><br>Could you do it in <b>one-pass</b>, using only <b>O(1) extra memory</b> and <b>without modifying</b> the value of the board?</p></div>"
