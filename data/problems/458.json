To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have <code>minutesToTest</code> minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.</p>\n\n<p>You can feed the pigs according to these steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Choose some live pigs to feed.</li>\n\t<li>For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time.</li>\n\t<li>Wait for <code>minutesToDie</code> minutes. You may <strong>not</strong> feed any other pigs during this time.</li>\n\t<li>After <code>minutesToDie</code> minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.</li>\n\t<li>Repeat this process until you run out of time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Given <code>buckets</code>, <code>minutesToDie</code>, and <code>minutesToTest</code>, return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> buckets = 1000, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 60\n<strong>Output:</strong> 5\n</pre><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n</pre><p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n</pre>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= buckets &lt;= 1000</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;=&nbsp;minutesToDie &lt;=&nbsp;minutesToTest &lt;= 100</code></li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
