    "content": "<div><p>We are given non-negative integers nums[i] which are written on a chalkboard.&nbsp; Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first.&nbsp; If erasing a number causes&nbsp;the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become&nbsp;0, then that player loses.&nbsp; (Also, we'll say the bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.</p>\n\n<p>Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.</p>\n\n<pre><strong>Example:</strong>\n<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1, 1, 2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> false\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nAlice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. \nIf she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. \nIf Alice erases 2 first, now nums becomes [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.\n\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Notes: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000</code>.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 2^16</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"
