You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:</b><br>\nThe array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n\n<pre>int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};\nSolution solution = new Solution(nums);\n\n// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.\nsolution.pick(3);\n\n// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.\nsolution.pick(1);\n</pre>\n</div>"
